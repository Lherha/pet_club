            <p><span4>The history of pets is intertwined with the process of animal domestication, and it is likely that the dog, as the first domesticated species, was also the first pet. 
                Perhaps the initial steps toward domestication were taken largely through the widespread human practice of making pets of captured young wild animals. 
                Eventually, a working relationship developed between the dogs and their human captors. 
                The dog was swifter, had stronger jaws, and was better at tracking prey; therefore, it could be of great use in hunting and guarding duties. From human beings, on the other hand, the dogs were assured of a constant supply of food as well as warmth from the fire. 
                There is indirect evidence that the dog may have been domesticated and kept as a pet since Paleolithic times, as can be surmised from the paintings and carvings that archaeologists have found in ancient campsites and tombs. 
                In Mesopotamia, dogs that look remarkably like the present-day mastiff were shown participating in a lion hunt. Domestic pets were often depicted in the scenes of family life in ancient Egypt; hunting dogs of the greyhound or saluki type accompany their master to the chase, and lap dogs frequently sit under the chair of their master or mistress.

    <h2>Pet Care Tips</h2>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p><span4>But as pet care costs rise, how do we do what’s best for our pet? Here are a few tips to help you save money on your pet’s health care. Don’t skip your pet’s yearly exam. It’s much more expensive and risky to treat illnesses than to protect against them. It’s also a good idea to shop veterinary practices by comparing fees for preventative care. Some vaccines are optional, while others are essential in preventing serious diseases. Never skip any shots required by local laws or mandatory for your pet’s protection, but do talk to your vet about personalizing your pet’s vaccine protocol. A good quality pet food formulated under the guidelines of the American Association of Feed Control Officials is often more cost-effective than a homemade diet. Avoid overfeeding your pet, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.</span4></p>
